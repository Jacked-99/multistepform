## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This was first somewhat big project with React. So i learned a lot. I learned how to use context and cotext provider and also expadned my knowledge about lifting the stat up and passing it down.

### Continued development

Of course I want to improve my React skills. But also CSS, because I wasn't quite happy about desktop layout of the app
